This software is written to change the information of your phone book numbers.
Have you ever searched for your phone numbers for various reasons such as - or - you cannot search correctly in the numbers of your contacts? (Especially in HTC phones.)
Or is it that when someone calls you, for the same reason, the number with a space or -, the person's name does not appear on your phone?
The purpose of this program is to sort your numbers. It can convert a number like +98-910-2000-xxx, which is stored in many people's phones and causes problems, to 00989102000xxx.
I wrote this program first for personal use, and then I decided to publish it.

The program code is available on Github and you can use it for development.
