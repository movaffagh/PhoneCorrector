# Phone Number Corrector

This software is designed to help you manage and format the phone numbers in your contacts.

Have you ever encountered issues while searching for phone numbers due to inconsistent formats like spaces, dashes, or country codes? This is especially common on some phones, such as HTC devices. Additionally, when someone calls you, their name might not appear because the number in your contacts has an inconsistent format like spaces or dashes.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this program is to **standardize your phone numbers**. For example, it can convert a number like `+98-910-2000-xxx`, which is stored in many phones and causes issues, into the format `00989102000xxx`.

### Features
- Automatically detects and corrects inconsistent phone number formats.
- Ensures all phone numbers are stored in a standardized format.
- Resolves issues with contact name display during calls caused by mismatched number formats.

### Background
I initially developed this program for personal use to address the formatting issues in my contacts. Later, I decided to share it with others who might face similar problems.

### Get Started
The program's code is available on GitHub for development and collaboration:

- **GitHub Repository**: [PhoneCorrector](https://github.com/movaffagh/PhoneCorrector)
- **Download from Cafe Bazaar**: [Number Corrector](https://cafebazaar.ir/app/ir.sanjaghakgroup.numbercorrector)

Feel free to contribute or use the app to simplify managing your phonebook contacts!
